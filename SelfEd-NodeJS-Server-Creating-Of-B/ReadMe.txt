SelfEd Title:       SelfEd-NodeJS-Server-Creating-Of-B
   
SelfEd Objective:   To learn more about HTTP services in Node.js

SelfEd Catalyst:    Had been learning and successfully implementing some basic 
                    Mongodb in SelfEd: SelfEd-NodeJS-MongoDB-Application when I
                    needed to review nodejs. I decided to go through the
                    TutorialsPoint lesson on NodeJS.

                    Link as follows:
                    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_introduction.htm

SelfEd Security:

(for example)
      		Cloud Server and Login Info:
      		Cloud Server via puTTy
      		IP:             192.169.169.55   	(Example)
      		Server name:    aisleCloud811	(Example)
      		puTTy port:     22 			(Example)
      		Data port:      3000 (port forwarding - seen as local host on cloud server?)	(Example)
      		Username:       bhcombes		(Example)
      		Password:       aisleView_59	(Example)

    I do want to learn more about node modules starting with the "require" 
    method(?) In the following example the module is 'express'  
    < var express = require('express'); >
    < https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_modules >
    So far the tutorial is very informative as of this page. 
    This page explains how to install, uninstall, list, create, etc. modules
    < https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_npm.htm >
    I got diverted to better understand callback functions for the sake 
    of asynchronous code I found this link:

    < https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-goes-asynchronous-awesome/ >

    I've been circling back around and meandering the stack and ended up here
    as part of my focus on < HTTP services >. There is a multitude of
    HTTP services offered by nodeJS, express, Angular, AJAX, etc.
