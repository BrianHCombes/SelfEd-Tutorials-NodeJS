SelfEd Title:       SelfEd-NodeJS-Event-Loops-Emitters-Buffers-Streams

SelfEd Objective:   To better understand event loops, emitters, buffers, and streams in NodeJS

SelfEd Catalyst:    It's the part of the TutorialsPoint lesson and also have 
                    been learning Asynchronous function calls (callbacks). 
                    Not happy (yet) with my attempts to create an asynchronous 
                    function call without NodeJS. Knowing javascript is single
                    thread, I want to learn the tricks. Hoping learning events
                    may bring  some insights.

Process:
        I'm currently going through the lesson(s) at:
                    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_event_loop.htm
                    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_event_emitter.htm

                    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_streams.htm
                    
        So far mostly nailing it. Each Exp suffix is a section of the lesson(s)  

        I did learn the 'fs' module is the 'file system' module.
        Look at this link with the fs.html part: 
                    https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html
        Perhaps all the other modules are found the same way.

        And yes, the zlib part takes you right there:
